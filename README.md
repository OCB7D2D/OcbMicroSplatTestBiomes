# OCB MicroSplat Test World Biomes Mod - Demo for OCB MicroSplat

Custom Biomes and World Demo Mod for [OcbMicroSplat][1].

This mod includes a custom map, named "Test Biomes", that consists
of 8 different biomes. The 5 vanilla biomes and 3 new custom ones.
I made no effort to customize biome foliage (plants, trees etc).
